    <h4> 
        Basketball's roots can be traced back to December 1891 when Dr. James Naismith, a physical education instructor in Springfield, Massachusetts, sought to create an indoor game to keep his students active during the winter months. Using a soccer ball and two peach baskets, Naismith developed a set of thirteen rules, giving birth to basketball.
        
        The sport quickly gained traction, spreading across the United States. In 1893, women's basketball had its inaugural game at Smith College, emphasizing basketball's inclusive nature from its early days. Over time, the game evolved, with new rules like dribbling introduced to enhance its dynamic nature.
        
        Organized leagues like the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) emerged, helping standardize the sport and foster its growth. The establishment of the Basketball Association of America (BAA) in 1946, later merging with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the NBA in 1949, marked a significant milestone, paving the way for professional basketball's rise.Today, basketball is played and followed by millions worldwide, with leagues and tournaments spanning continents. Its history reflects the sport's ability to unify people across cultures and borders, demonstrating the universal appeal of basketball as more than just a game but a shared passion that transcends boundaries and brings communities together
